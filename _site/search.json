Data are currently being collected using a variety of experimental tasks that target both production and receptive knowledge.\nAttitudes towards a standardized written norm for Andalusian Spanish  This project examines the attitudes towards Ettandâ pal Andalûh (Colectivo EPA, 2018), an alternative ortographic norm for Andalusian Spanish, a variety of Peninsular Spanish spoken in southern Spain. Data were collected from Reddit and analyzed following a discourse analysis approach (Walsh, 2022) combined with a stancetaking framework (Du Bois, 2007; Hilliard, 2023). The findings from the present project have several implications for Internet sociolinguistics and for theories on language ideologies and political affiliations.\nSpanish in central New Jersey  This project focuses on the Spanish spoken in New Jersey, in particular, in the greater New Brunswick area, with the aim of documenting its linguistic features and investigating language variation and change in this area. The outcome of this project will be the creation of a corpus of the Spanish language as currently used in central New Jersey. This project is lead by Dr. Kendra V. Dickinson.\n\n\nPrevious Projects\nInitiative on immigration and education, CUNY-IIE  This megaproject investigated the intersections between immigration and education in New York by focusing on mixed-status immigrant communities and education stakeholders, specifically their strengths, experiences, and needs. Through the lens of grounded theory (Corbin & Strauss, 1990), I analyzed a part of the education stakeholders data with Julissa Dilone and Teresita Goyeneche, under the supervision of Dr. Ariana Mangual Figueroa. You can find more information about CUNY-IIE in the official website.\nAlternative approaches to the teaching of Spanish to adult immigrants and refugees  This project tested ‘non-traditional approaches’ (task-based approach, cooperative learning, and writing as a social task) to the teaching of upper-beginning Spanish in an immigrant setting in Barcelona, Spain, as there was a lack of research on this population, even though Spain is considered one of the main destinations for international migration (Consejo Económico y Social, 2019). You can read about this project here and in Boletín ASELE, núm. 66.\n\n\n\n\nPublications\nFeliu Ribas, M. (2022).
